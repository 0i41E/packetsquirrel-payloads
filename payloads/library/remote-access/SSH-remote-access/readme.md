#Squirrel SSH Remote Access
____

### Concept:
The Packet Squirrel is a powerful tool, but lets say you wanted persistent access to a network
for a long period of time. This allows the user to remote into the squirrel to do things like
upload loot manually, and launch attacks on a network from the inside.
